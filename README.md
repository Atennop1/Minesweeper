## About project

This project was not planned at all. A couple of hours before New Years, I saw a Minesweeper-related meme and wondered, "How hard would it be to make your own Minesweeper?" Well, the very next day I started developing this project, and on January 5, 2023, the first version was ready

### Techniques and specifics
 - Project trying to use **OOP**
 - Clean **DI**
 - **MV** Arhitecture style, where model controls view. But this is don't work in some places of project
 - Composite Root
 - Much procedural code :(
 
### Tools
 - TMP
 - UniTask
 - Odin Inspector
 
## Conclusion

This project was a fun experience because I made a whole game in 5 days.. Also this project was the first experience in more procedural code than in the rest projects
