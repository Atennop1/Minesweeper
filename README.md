## About project

This project was not planned at all. A couple of hours before New Year, I saw a Minesweeper-related meme and wondered "How hard would it be to make your own Minesweeper?"
<br>Well, on the next day (1st January) I started developing this project, and on January 5, 2023, the first version was ready

### Techniques and specifics
 - Clean **DI**
 - Project trying to use **OOP**
 - **MV** Arhitecture style, where model controls view. But this is don't work in some places of project
 - Much procedural code :(
 
### Tools
 - TMP
 - UniTask
 - Odin Inspector
 
## Conclusion

This project was a fun experience because I made a whole game in 5 days. Also this project was the first experience in procedural projects where my OOP thinking doesn't works
